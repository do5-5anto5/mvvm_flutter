# Flutter MVVM Template

This is a template project for studying and implementing the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern in Flutter, following official Flutter team recommendations.

## Overview

This project serves as a practical example of implementing MVVM architecture in Flutter applications. MVVM helps separate concerns and make code more maintainable, testable, and scalable.

## Architecture

### Model
- Represents the data and business logic
- Manages data access and validation
- Independent of the UI

### View
- Represents the UI elements
- Observes the ViewModel
- Forwards user actions to ViewModel
- Stateless where possible

### ViewModel
- Acts as a bridge between Model and View
- Contains presentation logic
- Manages UI state
- Processes user actions
- Independent of specific UI implementations

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mvvm_template_with_flutter.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the app:
```bash
flutter run
```

## Best Practices

- Keep Views as dumb as possible
- ViewModels should not reference UI elements
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Implement proper state management
- Write unit tests for ViewModels and Models
- Keep business logic in the Model layer
